# SEA Stage 2 - Data Catalog Project

This is the instructions, requirements, and starter for stage two of the Snap Engineering Academy application process.

## Your Task:

<h3 align="center">Create a "catalog" website for something you're passionate about.</h1>

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used Github or programmed a website with JavaScript before, that's OK! Part of the challenge is figuring out things you're not familiar with.  

## Requirements - Your Catalog Website Should...

 - Show off your understanding of basic data structures: arrays and objects.  
 - Display a substantial amount of interesting data in a "Catalog"! You can look online for datasets or make your own. Your data should be easy to find in your source code, held either in variables defined at the top of scripts.js or imported from a file you added.  
 - Handle data "dynamically." If the data in your data structures changes, then your code should display those changes after a reload.
Have two or more features that “operate” on your data, modifying the data and how you display it. Data “operations” are things like filtering, searching, sorting, updating, adding, removing and so on. *Imagine what users would want to do while using your catalog website, and make it a feature!*  
 - Look polished. Use HTML and CSS to customize how you display your data. Display your data thoughtfully, as it’s much more useful that way!  
 - Be built from this starter code, though you can change anything you like. *The starter code shows a simple example of a data catalog website and introduces you to JS/html/css, but you should be making significant changes and improvements.*  
 - Be an original website. Please do not submit something you’ve already done for a school project, internship, or client. *Using online resources for reference and guidance is encouraged, but be a responsible developer and make sure you understand every line of code in your project.*


## Getting Started

1. Create a Github account if you haven't already.

2. Click the green "Use as Template" button in the upper right corner, then choose the "create a new repository" option.  
  a. Choose yourself as the owner  
  b. Give your repository a name  
  c. Click "Create Repository"  

3. Copy or Download the repository files to your own computer. There are many ways to do this, it's up to you!

4. Start editing the website by using a text editor for the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `scripts.js` files. As you edit, preview your website by opening `index.html` with your web browser (double clicking `index.html` should open it in a web browser). When you're done, you should see something like this:

## Submitting

1. Publish your website to the internet! You can use any method you like, but we recommend [Github Pages.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)

2. Update your Github repository so it has the most recent version of your website's source code.

3. Submit the URL to your published website and the link to your Github repository to the google form in your email.
